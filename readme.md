# Drowsy Detection

## Introduction

Drowsy Detection Using Computer Vision is a project aimed at preventing accidents caused by 
drowsy driving. The system analyzes the driver's face in real-time through a camera feed and 
alerts them with the audio if signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Algorithm

The drowsy detection algorithm is based on computer vision techniques, including:

- **Facial Landmarks:** Identifying key eyes landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):** Calculating the EAR to determine if the eyes are closing.


## Project Status

This project is currently under active development and code may not be available until work has been done.
